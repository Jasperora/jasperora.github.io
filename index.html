    <p><i>The term quasar originated as a contraction of quasi-stellar [star-like] radio source because quasars
         were first identified during the 1950s as sources of radio-wave emission of unknown physical origin,
          and when identified in photographic images at visible wavelengths they resembled faint, star-like points
           of light. High-resolution images of quasars, particularly from the Hubble Space Telescope, have demonstrated
            that quasars occur in the centers of galaxies, and that some host galaxies are strongly interacting or
             merging galaxies. As with other categories of AGN, the observed properties of a quasar depend on many
              factors, including the mass of the black hole, the rate of gas accretion, the orientation of the accretion
               disk relative to the observer, the presence or absence of a jet, and the degree of obscuration by gas and
                dust within the host galaxy.</i></p>

    <p>The first quasars (3C 48 and 3C 273) were discovered in the late 1950s, as radio sources in all-sky radio surveys.
         They were first noted as radio sources with no corresponding visible object. Using small telescopes and the Lovell 
         Telescope as an interferometer, they were shown to have a very small angular size.[19] By 1960, hundreds of these 
         objects had been recorded and published in the Third Cambridge Catalogue while astronomers scanned the skies for 
         their optical counterparts. In 1963, a definite identification of the radio source 3C 48 with an optical object was
          published by Allan Sandage and Thomas A. Matthews. Astronomers had detected what appeared to be a faint blue star at
           the location of the radio source and obtained its spectrum, which contained many unknown broad emission lines. The 
           anomalous spectrum defied interpretation.British-Australian astronomer John Bolton made many early observations of 
           quasars, including a breakthrough in 1962. Another radio source, 3C 273, was predicted to undergo five occultations
            by the Moon. Measurements taken by Cyril Hazard and John Bolton during one of the occultations using the Parkes Radio 
            Telescope allowed Maarten Schmidt to find a visible counterpart to the radio source and obtain an optical spectrum using 
            the 200-inch (5.1 m) Hale Telescope on Mount Palomar. This spectrum revealed the same strange emission lines. Schmidt was 
            able to demonstrate that these were likely to be the ordinary spectral lines of hydrogen redshifted by 15.8%, at the time, 
            a high redshift (with only a handful of much fainter galaxies known with higher redshift). If this was due to the physical 
            motion of the "star", then 3C 273 was receding at an enormous velocity, around 47000 km/s, far beyond the speed of any 
            known star and defying any obvious explanation.[20] Nor would an extreme velocity help to explain 3C 273's huge radio emissions. 
            If the redshift was cosmological (now known to be correct), the large distance implied that 3C 273 was far more luminous than 
            any galaxy, but much more compact. Also, 3C 273 was bright enough to detect on archival photographs dating back to the 1900s; 
            it was found to be variable on yearly timescales, implying that a substantial fraction of the light was emitted from a region l
            ess than 1 light-year in size, tiny compared to a galaxy.
        
        Although it raised many questions, Schmidt's discovery quickly revolutionized quasar observation. The strange spectrum of 3C 48 was quickly identified by Schmidt, Greenstein and Oke as hydrogen and magnesium redshifted by 37%. Shortly afterwards, two more quasar spectra in 1964 and five more in 1965 were also confirmed as ordinary light that had been redshifted to an extreme degree.[21] While the observations and redshifts themselves were not doubted, their correct interpretation was heavily debated, and Bolton's suggestion that the radiation detected from quasars were ordinary spectral lines from distant highly redshifted sources with extreme velocity was not widely accepted at the time.</p>
